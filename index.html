        <h4>Homework Help</h4>
        <li><u>General Tutoring:</u> Engineering undergraduate students may receive up to four hours per week of free one-on-one tutoring for each course. Engineering Student Services coordinates free tutoring for the math, chemistry and physics courses required for an Engineering degree. </li>
        <li><u>Calculus Help Room:</u> Graduate Teaching Assistants (TAs) staff a help desk for calculus courses (131,132, 233) and differential equations. Students who need help with homework during the evening may also visit the Calculus Help Desk in Cornerstone. The Calculus Help Room is located in Lopata Hall, Room 323.</li>
        <li><u>Cornerstone (The Center for Advanced Learning):</u> Cornerstone resources are available to help Washington University undergraduates succeed and persist to graduation in their chosen fields. Cornerstone offers active and collaborative learning opportunities to help students make the transition to college, master class materials in foundational courses, and prepare them for advanced courses and courses in their major.

Engineering students may be particularly interested in Cornerstone's peer-led, team-learning groups. This program pairs trained upperclassmen with small groups of students who work on group exercises directly connected to course work. Initially created in conjunction with the chemistry department to address the needs of freshman taking the introductory chemistry and lab classes, PLTL (Peer Led Team Learning) is now offered to biomedical engineering, physics and calculus students. Cornerstone is located in Gregg House on the first floor.
